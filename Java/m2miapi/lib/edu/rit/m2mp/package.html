<A NAME="sect1"><H2>1. Environment</H2></A>

<P>
The <A HREF="http://www.cs.rit.edu/~anhinga/" TARGET="_top">Anhinga Project</A>
is developing an infrastructure
for building distributed applications
involving <EM>many-to-many</EM> communication
in an <EM>ad-hoc</EM> network
of <EM>proximal mobile wireless</EM> devices.
Due to this environment,
existing network protocols are inadequate,
and new network protocols are needed.
<P>
A <EM>broadcast</EM> protocol seems promising at first blush.
Instead of sending a message to a particular address,
a device would broadcast a request
which all other devices would receive;
if a response was needed,
the proper device would send back a response.
For example:
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Java classfile downloading</B> &#151;
A device broadcasts a request message,
&#147;I need the classfile for class <TT>com.foo.bar</TT>.&#148;
The device that has the classfile
broadcasts a response message containing the classfile.
<P><LI>
<B>Distributed service lookup</B> &#151;
A device broadcasts a request message,
&#147;I need a service
that implements interface <TT>PrintService</TT>,
that supports color printing,
and that supports PDF files.&#148;
All devices that provide that service with those attributes
broadcast response messages.
<P><LI>
<B>Chat application</B> &#151;
Every device continually broadcasts messages,
&#147;User <I>whoever</I> just typed <I>whatever</I>.&#148;
Every device displays the contents of each incoming message.
</UL>
<P>
Thus, messages are processed based on <EM>what they say</EM>
(their contents)
rather than <EM>where they&#146;re sent</EM>
(their addresses).
<P>
Characteristics of a many-to-many protocol:
<UL>
<LI>There are no device addresses.
<LI>Messages are broadcast to all devices.
<LI>Message delivery is mostly reliable but not totally reliable.
<LI>Messages may be delivered to different devices in different orders.
<LI>There is no central server.
</UL>
<P>
&#147;Mostly reliable&#148; message delivery
means that most of the time,
a message broadcast by one device in the network
is received by all the other devices in the network.
However, on rare occasions
a message broadcast by one device
is not received by some or all of the other devices.
<P>
An address-free, content-based, unreliable broadcast protocol
would seem to match well the environment for which Anhinga is designed.
Wireless transmissions (or at least, wireless <EM>radio</EM> transmissions)
are inherently broadcast within a certain proximal area.
Since there are no addresses in the protocol,
mobile devices can enter and leave the network
in an ad-hoc fashion without having to maintain routing tables.
Since message delivery doesn&#146;t have to be reliable,
the protocol doesn&#146;t have to go to great lengths
to provide reliable delivery or ordering guarantees
in the face of devices constantly going up and down.
If an application requires end-to-end reliable message delivery or ordering,
that can be provided in a layer above the network protocol;
the network protocol shouldn&#146;t be expected
to provide end-to-end guarantees.
<A HREF="#ref1">[1]</A>
Since devices constantly enter and leave the network,
no one device can act as a central server
that is supposed to be always available.

<A NAME="sect2"><H2>2. Architecture</H2></A>

<P>
Figure 1 shows the protocol architecture.
Distributed applications in each device
are layered on top of
the Many-to-Many Protocol (M2MP).
M2MP in turn is layered on top of a broadcast medium.
Each application on each device
registers a message filter
with its own M2MP layer
(the small gray boxes in Figure 1).
An incoming message
whose contents match
what the application is looking for
is allowed to pass through
the application&#146;s message filter;
other incoming messages are not passed through.
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="doc-files/Fig1.png">
<BR><B>Figure 1. </B>Broadcast protocol architecture
</CENTER>
<P>
Figure 2 shows what happens
when an application on one device
sends a message via M2MP.
M2MP breaks the message into packets
and broadcasts each packet via the broadcast medium.
Every device receives each packet (barring failures).
If a packet&#146;s contents show that it is part of a message
that matches an application&#146;s message filter,
the M2MP layer
reassembles the original message from the packets
and passes the message to the application,
otherwise the M2MP layer ignores the packet.
The M2MP layer also ignores any incoming packets
that had been sent by itself.
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="doc-files/Fig2.png">
<BR><B>Figure 2. </B>Broadcast message transmission and reception
</CENTER>
<P>
If a failure occurs,
such as a lost packet,
the M2MP layer abandons the message
and signals an exception to the application.
Retransmitting lost packets is unnecessary,
and abandoning the message is acceptable,
because we assume the network is mostly reliable;
recovery from an occasional message loss
can be done at the application level.
This considerably simplifies M2MP.
<P>
It remains to describe how to implement a broadcast medium
for a group of proximal devices.
This depends on the underlying networking technology.
In the case of Ethernet, for example,
including wired Ethernet and wireless Ethernet (IEEE 802.11),
implementing a broadcast medium is easy:
Simply send all M2MP packets
to a well-known Ethernet group address.
All the M2MP devices instruct their Ethernet interfaces
to receive datagrams from that group address.
Thus, all devices connected to the same LAN segment
(or within wireless communication distance of each other)
will receive each other&#146;s M2MP packets.
This may be sufficient for most applications
involving proximal mobile devices.
To extend the group of proximal devices
beyond one LAN segment,
the multicast datagrams could be routed between LAN segments.
<P>
For purposes of prototyping,
M2MP could be implemented on top of UDP/IP.
Each M2MP packet is placed in a UDP datagram
and sent to a multicast address;
an unassigned address in the IPv4 local scope
of the administratively scoped IPv4 multicast space
(239.255.0.0 to 239.255.255.255)
is recommended <A HREF="#ref2">[2]</A>.
The multicast group with that address
constitutes the broadcast medium.
While acceptable for prototyping,
the additional overhead
of the UDP and IP layers
is unnecessary and undesirable
in a deployment environment;
it would be better
to layer M2MP at the network level
directly on top of Ethernet at the data link level.
<P>
It may be possible to implement a broadcast medium
on top of other wireless technologies.
Bluetooth, for example,
while designed for point-to-point communications
in cable replacement scenarios,
does include the ability
to broadcast messages
from the master device
to all slave devices in a piconet,
and the Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP) layer
supports &#147;group channels&#148;
which may be usable for message broadcasting.
<P>
While M2MP was originally intended
for use on a broadcast communication medium,
M2MP can also be used
to send messages on a point-to-point communication medium,
as shown in Figure 3.
In this case,
when an application sends an M2MP message,
it specifies the message&#146;s destination address.
(Destination addresses are not needed
on a broadcast communication medium.)
The communication medium delivers the message
to the M2MP layer at the destination address,
whereupon the message passes through
the matching message filters
to the applications
that have registered interest in the message.
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="doc-files/Fig3.png">
<BR><B>Figure 3. </B>Point-to-point message transmission and reception
</CENTER>
<P>
On a point-to-point communication medium,
M2MP can be viewed as a transport mechanism
whose capabilities fall between UDP and TCP.
Like UDP and unlike TCP,
M2MP message delivery is not guaranteed.
But like a TCP connection and unlike a UDP datagram,
an M2MP message can contain a very large amount of data.

<P>

<A NAME="sect3"><H2>3. Many-to-Many Protocol</H2></A>

<P>
This section describes the design of the Many-to-Many Protocol.

<P>
<A NAME="sect3p1"><H3>3.1. Maximum Packet Size</H3></A>
<P>
M2MP must be able to transport messages of any length.
Thus, M2MP needs to deal with fragmentation
in the underlying broadcast layer.
Consider a broadcast layer implemented using multicast UDP/IP.
A 576-byte or smaller IP packet is guaranteed not to be fragmented.
Subtracting 60 bytes for the maximum-size IP header
and 8 bytes for the UDP header
leaves 508 bytes for the payload.
In the case of Bluetooth,
an L2CAP group channel supports a minimum packet size
of 672 bytes.
Taking the lesser number,
each M2MP packet will be limited to a maximum of 508 bytes.

<P>
<A NAME="sect3p2"><H3>3.2. Packet Format</H3></A>
<P>
Table 1 shows the format of an M2MP packet.
Multibyte fields are stored in big-endian order
(most significant byte first).
Bits within a 32-bit field are numbered
from 31 (most significant bit)
to 0 (least significant bit).
Bits within a 16-bit field are numbered
from 15 (most significant bit)
to 0 (least significant bit).

<P>
The fields&#146; contents are as follows.
<UL>
<P><LI>
<B>Message ID</B> &#151;
A 32-bit number that uniquely identifies a message.
All packets of the same message have the same value in the message ID field.
Each sending device uses a collision-resistant sequence generator (CRSG)
to generate the message IDs for successive messages.
Each sending device seeds its CRSG with unique information &#151;
the concatenation of the device&#146;s Ethernet MAC address
and real-time clock is recommended.
This should guarantee a near-zero probability (2<SUP>&#150;32</SUP>)
that two different messages have the same message ID,
no matter which particular devices
are in the ad-hoc network at the time.
<P><LI>
<B>Last-packet flag</B> &#151;
0 if this is not the last packet in the message,
1 if this is the last packet in the message.
<P><LI>
<B>Fragment number</B> &#151;
The number of the message fragment
contained in this packet.
Fragments of a message are numbered sequentially
starting with 0.
<P><LI>
<I>N</I> &#151;
The length of this packet&#146;s message fragment in bytes.
The value of <I>N</I> is not carried within the packet,
rather it is calculated to be 10 less than
the length of the whole packet in bytes.
The length of the whole packet
is reported to the M2MP layer by the underlying layer.
The maximum value of <I>N</I> is 508 &#150; 10 = 498.
<P><LI>
<B>Message fragment</B> &#151;
The message fragment contained within this packet.
Each message fragment except possibly the last
is 498 bytes long.
<P><LI>
<B>Checksum</B> &#151;
Calculated as follows:
The bytes of the packet are arranged in pairs
in big-endian order
to form a sequence of 16-bit words.
If the message fragment&#146;s length is odd,
an extra zero byte is appended to the message fragment
for purposes of calculating the checksum
(the extra byte is not transmitted within the packet).
The words are summed up using one&#146;s complement arithmetic.
The sender fills in the checksum field
with the sum of the rest of the packet.
The receiver verifies that the sum of the rest of the packet
matches the checksum.
</UL>

<P>
<A NAME="sect3p3"><H3>3.3. Message Broadcast Process</H3></A>
<P>
To broadcast a message,
the M2MP layer generates the next message ID from its CRSG.
The M2MP layer breaks the message into fragments,
where each fragment except possibly the last is 498 bytes long.
The M2MP layer broadcasts a sequence of M2MP packets
containing the message fragments in order from first to last.
(Thus, a message can contain at most 2<SUP>31</SUP> x 498 bytes,
or nearly a terabyte.)

<P>
<A NAME="sect3p4"><H3>3.4. Message Filter Registration Process</H3></A>
<P>
If an application wants to receive broadcast messages
of a certain kind,
the application registers a <EM>message filter</EM>
with the M2MP layer.
The registration specifies a <EM>message prefix</EM>
in which the application is interested.
Thereafter, whenever the M2MP layer receives a message
whose initial bytes are equal to the message prefix registered
for a message filter,
the M2MP layer sends the message contents
(including the message prefix)
to that message filter.
The message prefix must be at most 498 bytes long;
this restriction is
so that the M2MP layer only has to examine
the first packet of a message
to decide whether to send it to a message filter.
<P>
It is up to the various distributed applications
to use unique message prefixes.
For example, an application that downloads Java codebases
could use a message prefix of &#147;<TT>&lt;CODEBASE&gt;</TT>&#148;.
A chat application
could use a message prefix of &#147;<TT>&lt;CHAT&gt;</TT>&#148;.
The messages themselves may be encoded in any format
the applications desire, such as XML/UTF-8, or a binary format.
To the M2MP layer, each message is just a byte sequence.
<P>
Multiple message filters may be registered
for the same message prefix.
In that case, the M2MP layer
will send a copy of the message
to each message filter.

<P>
<A NAME="sect3p5"><H3>3.5. Message Reception Process</H3></A>
<P>
The M2MP layer examines each packet received from the broadcast layer.
<P>
If the checksum is incorrect,
the M2MP layer discards the packet.
<P>
Otherwise, if it is the first packet
(fragment number = 0)
of a new message
(message ID not the same
as any message currently being passed
to a message filter)
in which one or more message filters are interested
(message&#146;s initial bytes match
the registered message prefix(es)),
the M2MP layer passes the message fragment
to the registered message filter(s).
If there are further packets in the message
(last packet flag = 0),
the M2MP layer starts a timeout
for receiving the next packet in the message.
The length of the timeout is implementation-dependent.
<P>
Otherwise, if it is the next packet
of a message in progress
(message ID = that of the message in progress
and fragment number = next expected fragment number),
the M2MP layer stops the timeout for that message
and passes the message fragment
to the registered message filter(s).
If there are further packets in the message
(last packet flag = 0),
the M2MP layer starts a timeout
for receiving the next packet in the message.
The length of the timeout is implementation-dependent.
<P>
Otherwise, the M2MP layer discards the packet.
<P>
If a message&#146;s timeout expires,
the M2MP layer stops receiving that message
and reports an exception
to the registered message filter(s).
<P>
The M2MP layer is permitted to place
implementation-dependent limits
on the number of messages in progress
and on the number of message fragments
not yet consumed by message listeners.
If a new packet arrives
that would cause the M2MP layer to exceed the limit,
the M2MP layer ignores the packet.
This restriction is so that the M2MP implementation
won&#146;t use unbounded buffer space
in a small device.

<A NAME="sect4"><H2>4. Package Structure</H2></A>

<P>
This package, package edu.rit.m2mp,
contains the main API for M2MP.
<P>
M2MP uses a <EM>channel</EM>
to interface the main protocol classes
to the underlying communication medium.
Package <A HREF="ip/package-summary.html">edu.rit.m2mp.ip</A>
contains channels that convey M2MP packets as UDP datagrams
sent to and received from an IP unicast or multicast address and port.
See that package
for further information
on how to use these channels.
<P>
Package <A HREF="debug/package-summary.html">edu.rit.m2mp.debug</A>
contains channels useful for debugging an M2MP application.
See that package
for further information
on how to use these channels.
<P>
Package <A HREF="packet/package-summary.html">edu.rit.m2mp.packet</A>
contains classes that encapsulate
the M2MP packets.
Applications do not need to use the classes in this package;
however, these classes must be included in the classpath
when running an application using the M2MP API.
<P>
Package <A HREF="test/package-summary.html">edu.rit.m2mp.test</A>
contains test programs.
See this package
for examples of simple console applications
that use the M2MP API.

<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="sect5"><H2>5. Designing Applications With the M2MP API</H2></A>

<P>
M2MP is typically used
as the messaging layer underneath
Many-to-Many Invocation (M2MI).
M2MI-based applications deal with the M2MI layer
and do not deal directly with the M2MP layer.
See package <A HREF="../m2mi/package-summary.html">edu.rit.m2mi</A>
for further information about M2MI.
<P>
This section describes how to design applications
that deal with M2MP directly
and do not use M2MI.
<P>
The classes in package edu.rit.m2mp
implement the M2MP layer.
You simply build your application
using the M2MP API to broadcast and receive messages.
Typically, your application needs four things:
an M2MP channel,
an M2MP protocol instance,
a transmitting thread,
and a receiving thread.
The transmitting thread is typically the main program thread,
or the AWT thread in a GUI application.
<P>
The M2MP channel object
implements the communication medium
that M2MP will use.
To get an M2MP channel,
create an instance of a class
that implements interface <A HREF="Channel.html">Channel</A>.
At present, three channel implementations are available:
<UL>
<P><LI>
Class <A HREF="ip/M2MPRouterChannel.html">edu.rit.m2mp.ip.M2MPRouterChannel</A>
is a broadcast channel
that sends M2MP messages to all processes running M2MP
on the local host.
For this channel to work,
a separate daemon process,
class <A HREF="ip/M2MPRouter.html">edu.rit.m2mp.ip.M2MPRouter</A>,
must be running on the local host.
If desired, the M2MP Router
can also convey M2MP messages
between the local host
and an external network.
<P><LI>
Class <A HREF="ip/IPMulticastChannel.html">edu.rit.m2mp.ip.IPMulticastChannel</A>
is a broadcast channel
that uses multicast UDP/IP
to transport M2MP packets;
all hosts listening to a certain multicast group IP address
and UDP port number
will receive the packets.
<P><LI>
Class <A HREF="ip/IPUnicastChannel.html">edu.rit.m2mp.ip.IPUnicastChannel</A>
is a point-to-point channel
that uses unicast UDP/IP
to transport M2MP packets;
a message&#146;s destination address
is the IP address and UDP port number
of the destination M2MP layer.
</UL>
<P>
See package
<A HREF="ip/package-summary.html">edu.rit.m2mp.ip</A>
for further information on these channel implementations.
Future releases of the M2MP API
will include additional channel implementations
that layer M2MP on top of different communication media.
<P>
The M2MP protocol instance
implements the M2MP layer itself.
To get an M2MP protocol instance,
create an instance of class <A HREF="Protocol.html">Protocol</A>,
passing the M2MP channel object
to the Protocol constructor.
<P>
The transmitting thread sends messages on the M2MP channel.
To send a message,
first create an <A HREF="OutgoingMessage.html">OutgoingMessage</A> object
by calling a factory method on the M2MP protocol instance,
then get an output stream
by calling a method on the outgoing message object.
Write the message contents to the output stream,
then close the output stream.
This causes the message to be sent
on the channel.
<P>
The receiving thread receives and processes
selected messages from the M2MP channel.
To receive messages,
first create an
<A HREF="IncomingMessageNotifier.html">IncomingMessageNotifier</A> object
by calling a factory method on the M2MP protocol instance.
Register one or more <A HREF="MessageFilter.html">MessageFilter</A> objects
with the incoming message notifier
to specify which messages the application wants to receive.
Once the incoming message notifier is set up,
call a method on the incoming message notifier
to get the next <A HREF="IncomingMessage.html">IncomingMessage</A> object,
then get an input stream
by calling a method on the incoming message object.
Read the message contents from the input stream
and process the message,
then close the input stream.
Then go back and obtain the next incoming message.
<P>
So as not to consume unbounded memory on small devices,
an M2MP protocol instance
has a pool of packet buffers
which are used to hold outgoing and incoming packets.
The pool has a fixed maximum number of packet buffers.
Any of the following
may cause the packet pool to run out of packets:
<UL>
<P><LI>
Failing to close the output stream
when done writing an outgoing message,
including if an exception is thrown while writing.
<P><LI>
Failing to close the input stream
when done reading an incoming message,
including if an exception is thrown while reading.
<P><LI>
Failing to accept and read incoming messages
from an open incoming message notifier.
<P><LI>
Failing to close an incoming message notifier
when no longer accepting messages from it.
<P><LI>
Sending outgoing messages at a faster rate
than receiving incoming messages.
This can happen if the sending thread
doesn't let the receiving thread have enough processor time.
</UL>
<P>
When the packet pool runs out of packets,
incoming messages will no longer be received,
and creating an outgoing message
will throw an
<A HREF="packet/OutOfPacketsException.html">OutOfPacketsException</A>.
Make sure your M2MP application is designed properly
and does not get into the above situations.

<DL COMPACT>

<P><DT>02-Jul-2002
<DD>
Changed the channel implementation
used to broadcast M2MP messages
to all processes on the local host
so it will work properly on Sun Solaris systems
as well as Linux systems;
the implementation is now contained in classes
edu.rit.m2mp.ip.M2MPRouter (revised) and
edu.rit.m2mp.ip.M2MPRouterChannel (new).

<P><DT>07-Jun-2002
<DD>
Changed the way incoming messages
are matched against message filters
in order to speed up the process.
Changed the semantics
of an M2MP protocol instance
such that an outgoing message sent via a protocol instance
is not received by that protocol instance.
Revamped the channel architecture and packaging.
Released under the terms of the Gnu General Public License
(no longer the Gnu Lesser General Public License).

<P><DT>21-Dec-2001
<DD>
A major redesign of the M2MP API.
The design of the class hierarchy was simplified.
The M2MP API is now analogous
to the J2ME CLDC Generic Connection Framework.
Changed to use delegation instead of inheritance
to hook the communication medium up to the M2MP protocol;
that is, the channel implementation
is now a separate class
instead of a subclass.
This also provides the ability to set up
&#147;channel pipelines.&#148;
Added support for point-to-point communication media
as well as broadcast communication media,
allowing M2MP to be used
for point-to-point networking.
Changed the specification of the M2MP packet checksum
to use one&#146;s complement arithmetic
instead of two&#146;s complement arithmetic;
<EM>packets generated by prior versions of M2MP
