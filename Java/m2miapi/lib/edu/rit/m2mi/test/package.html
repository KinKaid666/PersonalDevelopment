Package edu.rit.m2mi.test
contains test and demonstration programs
for distributed applications
based on Many-to-Many Invocation (M2MI).
There are three:
<A HREF="#chatdemo">Chat Demo</A>,
<A HREF="#pingpong">Ping-Pong Demo</A>,
and <A HREF="#m2miwatch">M2MIWatch</A>.

<B>M2MI Library Version 02-Jul-2002</B>

<A NAME="chatdemo"><H2>1. Chat Demo</H2></A>

<P>
The Chat Demo
(class <A HREF="ChatDemo.html">ChatDemo</A>)
is a rudimentary chat application using M2MI.

<P>
<H3>1.1. Running the M2MP Router</H3>

<P>
Before you can run the Chat Demo itself,
you must run the M2MP Router
(class <A HREF="../../m2mp/ip/M2MPRouter.html">edu.rit.m2mp.ip.M2MPRouter</A>)
in a separate process.
Type this command:
<P>
<TT>java edu.rit.m2mp.ip.M2MPRouter</TT>
<P>
If you would like the M2MP Router to tell you what it's doing,
type this command instead:
<P>
<TT>java edu.rit.m2mp.ip.M2MPRouter -v</TT>

<P>
<H3>1.2. Running the Chat Demo</H3>

<P>
To run one instance of the Chat Demo,
type this command,
supplying the desired user name:
<P>
<TT>java edu.rit.m2mi.test.ChatDemo <I>username</I></TT>
<P>
It will display a UI like this:
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="doc-files/chatdemo.png">
</CENTER>
<P>
To run several instances of the Chat Demo,
execute the above command in several separate processes,
giving a different user name each time.
All these instances constitute the "chat session."
<P>
To send a message to the chat session,
type the message in the text field at the bottom of the UI
and click the "Send" button (or hit RETURN).
The message will appear in all the Chat Demo instances
that are running.

<P>
<H3>1.3. Under the Hood</H3>

<P>
The Chat Demo program exports a chat object
(class <A HREF="ChatObject.html">ChatObject</A>)
that implements interface <A HREF="Chat.html">Chat</A>,
which is:
<PRE>
    public interface Chat {
        public void putLine (String line);
    }</PRE>
<P>
When the user types a line of text in the UI,
the chat object broadcasts the line to all the exported chat objects
by calling <TT>putLine()</TT> on an omnihandle for interface Chat.
The M2MI layer then performs remote method invocations
on all the chat objects that are out there
in all the processes.
The invocations are transported between processes
using Many-to-Many Protocol (M2MP) messages.
(See package <A HREF="../../m2mp/package-summary.html">edu.rit.m2mp</A>.)
When each chat object receives a <TT>putLine()</TT> invocation,
it displays the line of text in the chat log in its UI.
In this way the line of text appears
in all the Chat Demo programs that are running.
<P>
Notice how the M2MI-based chat application
differs from typical distributed applications.
There is no chat server.
The Chat Demo programs do not have to connect to a server.
The Chat Demo programs do not have to connect to each other.
Consequently, the Chat Demo programs
do not need to know any network addresses
(of servers or other clients).
M2MI-based applications need no network configuration or administration,
making M2MI-based applications easy to develop and deploy,
especially in an ad hoc network.
<P>
Notice too how the M2MI-based chat application's
remote method invocations
differ from remote method invocations using Java RMI.
There is no RMI compiler (<TT>rmic</TT>),
no proxy classes,
and no codebase server.
Instead, M2MI synthesizes its own proxy classes
internally as needed.
M2MI-based applications need none of Java RMI's ancillary apparatus,
again making M2MI-based applications easy to develop and deploy,
especially in an ad hoc network.

<P>
<H3>1.4. Routing Issues</H3>

<P>
The Many-to-Many Protocol broadcasts messages
to all processes
by sending UDP datagrams
to port 5678
on the "localhost" IP address,
127.0.0.1.
(See class <A HREF="../../m2mp/ip/M2MPRouterChannel.html">edu.rit.m2mp.ip.M2MPRouterChannel</A>.)
The M2MP Router receives each message
and sends a copy back
to each process with an M2MP layer.
For this to work properly,
the operating system's IP routing table
must be configured to route IP address 127.0.0.1
to the "loopback" network interface.
Consult your operating system documentation
to discover how to configure the loopback interface
and the IP routing table.
<P>
For example, here is the output
of the <TT>netstat</TT> program
for a properly-configured IP routing table
on a Linux system:
<P>
<FONT SIZE="-1"><PRE>$ netstat -rn
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface
. . .
127.0.0.0       0.0.0.0         255.0.0.0       U        40 0          0 lo</PRE></FONT>

<P>
<H3>1.4. Two Hosts</H3>

<P>
You can also run instances of the Chat Demo
on separate host machines.
If you do that, though,
you must configure the M2MP Router
to broadcast M2MP messages between the hosts.
To broadcast between two hosts
named <TT>"host1"</TT> and <TT>"host2"</TT>
(substitute the actual host names or IP addresses),
execute this command
in a separate process on <TT>host1</TT>:
<P>
<TT>java edu.rit.m2mp.ip.M2MPRouter -s host2 -r host1</TT>
<P>
And execute this command in a separate process on <TT>host2</TT>:
<P>
<TT>java edu.rit.m2mp.ip.M2MPRouter -s host1 -r host2</TT>
<P>
The command line arguments are the address to send messages to
(the other host's address)
and the address to receive messages from
(this host's own address).
Now messages sent to the chat session
will appear in all Chat Demo instances
running on both hosts.
<P>
Under the hood,
the M2MP Router receives each M2MP datagram
from the local host
and forwards the datagram to the other host's IP address and port.
Simultaneously,
the M2MP Router receives each M2MP datagram
which the other host sends
to its own host's IP address and port
and forwards the datagram to the local host.
This establishes a "tunnel" between the two hosts,
such that all M2MI invocations generated on the one host
are broadcast on the other host
and vice versa.

<P>
<H3>1.5. More Than Two Hosts</H3>

<P>
To broadcast M2MP messages between two or more hosts
using IP multicasting,
execute this command in a separate process on each host:
<P>
<TT>java edu.rit.m2mp.ip.M2MPRouter -m 239.255.0.1</TT>
<P>
The command line argument is
a multicast IP address
to send messages to
and receive messages from.
The multicast IP address must be
in the range 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255
(pick an unused one).
Now messages sent to the chat session
will appear in all Chat Demo instances
running on all the hosts.
<P>
Under the hood,
the M2MP Router operates exactly as before,
except it sends datagrams to
and receives datagrams from
the multicast IP address.
M2MI invocations generated on one host in that multicast group
are broadcast to all hosts in the multicast group.
<P>
For this to work properly,
each host's network interface must have multicasting enabled,
and each host's IP routing table must have a multicast route
to that network interface.
Consult your operating system documentation
to discover how to configure the network interface
and the IP routing table for multicast.
<P>
For example, here is the output
of the <TT>netstat</TT> program
for a properly-configured IP routing table
on a Linux system:
<P>
<FONT SIZE="-1"><PRE>$ netstat -rn
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface
. . .
224.0.0.0       0.0.0.0         240.0.0.0       U        40 0          0 eth0</PRE></FONT>

<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="pingpong"><H2>2. Ping-Pong Demo</H2></A>

<P>
To run the Ping-Pong Demo,
start the M2MP Router in its own process as above.
Then execute this command
(class <A HREF="Ping.html">Ping</A>)
in one process:
<P>
<TT>java edu.rit.m2mi.test.Ping</TT>
<P>
Execute this command
(class <A HREF="Pong.html">Pong</A>)
in a second process:
<P>
<TT>java edu.rit.m2mi.test.Pong</TT>
<P>
Finally, execute this command
(class <A HREF="StartPingPong.html">StartPingPong</A>)
in a third process:
<P>
<TT>java edu.rit.m2mi.test.StartPingPong</TT>
<P>
The Ping program will print <TT>Ping 1</TT>,
then the Pong program will print <TT>Pong 2</TT>,
then the Ping program will print <TT>Ping 3</TT>,
then the Pong program will print <TT>Pong 4</TT>,
and so on.
<P>
Under the hood,
all three programs are invoking methods
on an omnihandle for interface <A HREF="PingPong.html">PingPong</A>.
The Ping and Pong programs
each export an object
that implements interface PingPong.
The StartPingPong program calls <TT>ping(1)</TT> and exits.
Executing the <TT>ping()</TT> method,
the Ping object prints a message,
waits one second,
and calls <TT>pong(2)</TT>.
Executing the <TT>pong()</TT> method,
the Pong object prints a message,
waits one second,
and calls <TT>ping(3)</TT>.
And so on forever.
<P>
You can also run the Ping-Pong Demo programs
on different hosts,
as long as you also run an M2MP Router process
on each host
that broadcasts messages between the hosts
as described above.

<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="m2miwatch"><H2>3. M2MIWatch</H2></A>

<P>
To run the M2MIWatch program
(class <A HREF="M2MIWatch.html">M2MIWatch</A>),
start the M2MP Router in its own process as above,
then execute this command in a separate process:
<P>
<TT>java edu.rit.m2mi.test.M2MIWatch</TT>
<P>
The M2MIWatch program listens for M2MP messages
being sent on the local host
that contain M2MI invocations.
For each M2MI invocation,
the M2MIWatch program prints one line on the standard output
containing these items (separated by commas):
<UL>
<LI>
Magic number for M2MI messages, 1295142217 (0x4D324D49, or "M2MI" in ASCII).
<LI>
Hash code each M2MI layer uses to decide whether to process the message.
<LI>
Exported object identifier (EOID).
<LI>
Target interface name.
<LI>
Target method name.
<LI>
Target method descriptor.
<LI>
Number of bytes of the serialized method arguments.
<LI>
Bytes of the serialized method arguments, if any.
</UL>
<P>
Use the M2MIWatch program
to verify that M2MI invocations
are in fact being sent.
