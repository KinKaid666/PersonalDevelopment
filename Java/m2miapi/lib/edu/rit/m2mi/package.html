<A NAME="overview"><H2>1. M2MI Concepts</H2></A>

<P>
Remote method invocation (RMI) [<A HREF="#WRW96">WRW96</A>]
can be viewed as
an object oriented abstraction
of point-to-point communication:
what looks like a method call
is in fact a message sent
and a response sent back.
In the same way,
M2MI can be viewed as
an object oriented abstraction
of broadcast communication.

<P>
<H3>1.1. Handles</H3>

<P>
M2MI lets an application invoke a method
declared in an interface.
To do so,
the application needs
some kind of "reference"
upon which to perform the invocation.
In M2MI, a reference is called a <EM>handle,</EM>
and there are three varieties,
omnihandles, unihandles, and multihandles.

<P>
<H3>1.2. Omnihandles</H3>

<P>

<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>Figure 1: An omnihandle</B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<P>
An <EM>omnihandle</EM> for an interface
stands for "every object out there
that implements this interface."
An application can ask the M2MI layer
to create an omnihandle for a certain interface <I>X</I>,
called the omnihandle's <EM>target interface</EM>.
(A handle can implement
more than one target interface if desired.)
Figure 1 depicts an omnihandle for interface <TT>Foo</TT>;
the omnihandle is named <TT>allFoos</TT>.
It is created by code like this:
<PRE>
Foo allFoos = (Foo) M2MI.getOmnihandle (Foo.class);</PRE>
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="doc-files/Fig2.png">
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>Figure 2: Invoking a method on an omnihandle</B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<P>
Once an omnihandle is created,
calling method <I>Y</I> on the omnihandle for interface <I>X</I> means,
"Every object out there that implements interface <I>X</I>,
perform method <I>Y</I>."
The method is performed by whichever objects
implementing interface <I>X</I>
exist at the time the method is <EM>invoked</EM> on the omnihandle.
Thus, different objects could respond to an omnihandle invocation
at different times.
Figure 2 shows what happens
when the statement <TT>allFoos.y();</TT> is executed.
Three objects implementing interface <TT>Foo</TT>,
objects <I>A</I>, <I>B</I>, and <I>D</I>,
happen to be in existence at that time;
so all three objects perform method <TT>y</TT>.
<P>
The target objects invoked by an M2MI method call
need not reside in the same process
as the calling object.
The target objects can reside
in other processes and/or other devices.
As long as the target objects
are in range to receive a broadcast
from the calling object over the network,
the M2MI layer will find the target objects
and perform a <EM>remote</EM> method invocation
on each one.
(M2MI's remote method invocation does not, however,
use the same mechanism as Java RMI.)

<P>
<H3>1.3. Exporting Objects</H3>

<P>
To receive invocations on a certain interface <I>X</I>,
an application creates an object
that implements interface <I>X</I>
and <EM>exports</EM> the object to the M2MI layer.
Thereafter,
the M2MI layer will invoke that object's method <I>Y</I>
whenever anyone calls method <I>Y</I>
on an omnihandle for interface <I>X</I>.
An object is exported with code like this:
<PRE>
M2MI.export (b, Foo.class);</PRE>
<P>
<TT>Foo.class</TT> is the class of the target interface
through which M2MI invocations
will come to the object.
We say the object is "exported as type <TT>Foo</TT>."
M2MI also lets an object
be exported as more than one type
(more than one target interface).
<P>
Once exported,
an object stays exported
until explicitly unexported with code like this:
<PRE>
M2MI.unexport (b);</PRE>
<P>
In other words, M2MI does not do
distributed garbage collection (DGC).
In many distributed collaborative applications,
DGC is unwanted;
an object that is exported by one device
as part of a distributed application
should remain exported
even if there are no other devices
invoking the object yet.
In cases where DGC is needed,
it can be provided by a leasing mechanism
explicit in the interface.
Omitting DGC simplifies M2MI.

<P>
<H3>1.4. Unihandles</H3>

<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="doc-files/Fig3.png">
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>Figure 3: A unihandle</B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<P>
A <EM>unihandle</EM> for an interface
stands for "one particular object out there
that implements this interface."
An application can export an object
and have the M2MI layer return a unihandle for that object.
Unlike an omnihandle,
a unihandle is bound to one particular object
at the time the unihandle is created.
Figure 3 depicts a unihandle for object <I>B</I>
implementing interface <TT>Foo</TT>;
the unihandle is named <TT>b_Foo</TT>.
It is created by code like this:
<PRE>
Foo b_Foo = (Foo) M2MI.getUnihandle (b, Foo.class);</PRE>
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="doc-files/Fig4.png">
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>Figure 4: Invoking a method on a unihandle</B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<P>
Once a unihandle is created,
calling method <I>Y</I> on the unihandle means,
"The particular object out there associated with this unihandle,
perform method <I>Y</I>."
When the statement <TT>b_Foo.y();</TT> is executed,
only object <I>B</I> performs the method,
as shown in Figure 4.
As with an omnihandle,
the target object for a unihandle invocation
need not reside in the same process or device
as the calling object.

<P>
<H3>1.5. Multihandles</H3>

<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="doc-files/Fig5.png">
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>Figure 5: A multihandle</B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<P>
A <EM>multihandle</EM> for an interface
stands for "one particular set of objects out there
that implement this interface."
Unlike a unihandle which only refers to one object,
a multihandle can refer to one or more than one object.
But unlike an omnihandle
which automatically refers to all objects
that implement a certain target interface,
a multihandle only refers to those objects
that have been explicitly <EM>attached</EM> to the multihandle.
Figure 5 depicts a multihandle
implementing target interface <TT>Foo</TT>;
the multihandle is named <TT>some_Foos</TT>,
and it is attached to two objects, <I>A</I> and <I>D</I>.
The multihandle is created and attached to the objects
by code like this:
<PRE>
Foo someFoos = (Foo) M2MI.getMultihandle (Foo.class);
((Multihandle) someFoos).attach (a);
((Multihandle) someFoos).attach (d);</PRE>
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="doc-files/Fig6.png">
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>Figure 6: Invoking a method on a multihandle</B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<P>
Once a multihandle is created,
calling method <I>Y</I> on the multihandle means,
"The particular object or objects out there
associated with this multihandle,
perform method <I>Y</I>."
When the statement <TT>someFoos.y();</TT> is executed,
objects <I>A</I> and <I>D</I> perform the method,
but not objects <I>B</I> or <I>C</I>,
as shown in Figure 6.
As with an omnihandle or unihandle,
the target objects for a multihandle invocation
need not reside in the same process or device
as the calling object or each other.
<P>
An object can also be detached from a multihandle
by code like this:
<PRE>
((Multihandle) someFoos).detach (a);</PRE>

<P>
<H3>1.6. Characteristics of M2MI Invocations</H3>

<P>
Methods in interfaces invoked via M2MI
can have arguments.
When an object of a non-primitive type
(including an array type)
is passed directly as an M2MI method call argument,
the object is normally <EM>passed by copy;</EM>
manipulations of the argument by the method call recipient
do not affect the original object in the caller.
However, when a unihandle for an exported object
is passed as an M2MI method call argument,
the object is effectively <EM>passed by reference;</EM>
invocations performed by the method call recipient
on the argument (unihandle)
come back to the original object via M2MI
and thus do affect the original object in the caller.
An omnihandle or multihandle can also be passed
as an M2MI method call argument,
and it behaves the same way in the method call recipient
as it does in the caller.
Primitive types are always passed by copy in M2MI.
<P>
M2MI uses Java's object serialization
to marshal the method call arguments on the calling side
and unmarshal them again on the target side.
Accordingly, every non-primitive object
passed in as an M2MI method call argument
must be serializable,
or the invocation will fail.
<P>
While M2MI can pass objects as arguments like Java RMI,
M2MI does not download the argument objects' classes
to the destination as Java RMI does.
With M2MI, the destination must already possess
the argument objects' classes,
or the invocation will fail.
If a handle is passed as an argument
in an M2MI method call, though,
the destination need only possess
the handle's target interface or interfaces.
(The destination's M2MI layer
already possesses all the classes needed
to implement handles.)
<P>
Although they can have arguments,
methods in interfaces invoked via M2MI
must be declared not to return a value
and not to throw any exceptions.
This is because with potentially more than one object
performing the method,
there is no single return value or exception to return or throw.
<P>
Since an M2MI method does not return anything,
the caller cannot get any information back from the called object
<EM>in the same method call.</EM>
If the caller needs to get information back,
the caller can send a reference to its own object
by passing the object's unihandle
as an argument to a method invoked on a handle.
The called object or objects can then send information back
by performing subsequent method invocations
on the original caller's unihandle.
This typically leads to a pattern of <EM>asynchronous</EM>
method calls and callbacks
in an M2MI-based application;
in other words, an <EM>event-driven</EM> application.
<P>
For the same reason,
an M2MI method invocation
does not give any indication
of whether the invocation was successfully communicated
to the called objects.
If an M2MI-based application needs an acknowledgment
that a method call in fact reached the called objects,
the called objects must do a separate method invocation
back to the calling object.
However, some applications can be designed
not to need explicit method acknowledgments at all,
achieving fault recovery by other means.
<P>
Finally, M2MI invocations are <EM>non-blocking.</EM>
An M2MI method call returns immediately
to the calling object
without waiting for all the target objects
to execute their methods.
Later, when the method invocations are actually performed,
every method in every target object is (potentially) executed
concurrently by a separate thread.
Therefore, every object exported via M2MI
must be designed to be multiple thread safe.
Furthermore, like any concurrent application,
the overall M2MI-based application
must be designed to avoid deadlocks,
to work properly
with any ordering of the concurrent method calls,
and so on.

<A NAME="usage"><H2>2. Using the M2MI Library</H2></A>

<P>
This section gives an overview
of how to use the M2MI Library.
For more detailed information,
refer to the documentation
for the various classes and methods.
<P>
The key component is class <A HREF="M2MI.html">M2MI</A>,
which encapsulates the M2MI layer
and provides static methods for working with M2MI.
Also important are the <A HREF="Handle.html">Handle</A> interface
and its subinterfaces
<A HREF="Omnihandle.html">Omnihandle</A>,
<A HREF="Unihandle.html">Unihandle</A>, and
<A HREF="Multihandle.html">Multihandle</A>.

<P>
<H3>2.1. Initialization</H3>

<P>
Before doing anything else,
you must initialize the M2MI layer by calling the
<A HREF="M2MI.html#initialize(long)"><TT>M2MI.initialize()</TT></A> method.
<P>
There are several variants of this method
that let you specify various optional parameters
to configure the M2MI layer.
The default configuration obtained
by omitting the optional parameters
is usually adequate for working with M2MI.
The default configuration will be described below
after describing the architecture of M2MI.

<P>
<H3>2.2. Working With Omnihandles</H3>

<P>
To export an object so it can be invoked via an omnihandle, call
<A HREF="M2MI.html#export(java.lang.Object, java.lang.Class)"><TT>M2MI.export(Object,Class)</TT></A>,
specifying the object to be exported
and the target interface with which to export it.
<P>
To export an object with multiple target interfaces, call
<A HREF="M2MI.html#export(java.lang.Object, java.lang.Class[])"><TT>M2MI.export(Object,Class[])</TT></A>,
specifying the object to be exported
and an array of target interfaces.
<P>
To obtain an omnihandle for a certain target interface, call
<A HREF="M2MI.html#getOmnihandle(java.lang.Class)"><TT>M2MI.getOmnihandle(Class)</TT></A>,
specifying the target interface.
An omnihandle is returned.
<P>
To obtain an omnihandle for multiple target interfaces, call
<A HREF="M2MI.html#getOmnihandle(java.lang.Class[])"><TT>M2MI.getOmnihandle(Class[])</TT></A>,
specifying an array of target interfaces.
An omnihandle is returned.
<P>
The returned omnihandle object implements interfaces
<A HREF="Handle.html">Handle</A> and
<A HREF="Omnihandle.html">Omnihandle</A>.
The returned omnihandle object also implements
the specified target interface(s).
To invoke a certain target method
on all exported objects
that implement a certain target interface,
cast the omnihandle object to the target interface,
then call the target method on the omnihandle object.
<P>
An exported object can be unexported by calling
<A HREF="M2MI.html#unexport(java.lang.Object)"><TT>M2MI.unexport(Object)</TT></A>,
specifying the desired object.
Afterwards, the object can no longer be invoked
via <EM>any</EM> handle
(omnihandle, unihandle, or multihandle)
that formerly referred to that object.
<P>
An omnihandle implements the
<A HREF="Omnihandle.html#equals(java.lang.Object)"><TT>equals()</TT></A> and
<A HREF="Omnihandle.html#hashCode()"><TT>hashCode()</TT></A> methods.
Thus, omnihandles can be used with the Java Collections Framework
as set elements, map keys, and so on.

<P>
<H3>2.3. Working With Unihandles</H3>

<P>
To export an object so it can be invoked via a unihandle, call
<A HREF="M2MI.html#getUnihandle(java.lang.Object, java.lang.Class)"><TT>M2MI.getUnihandle(Object,Class)</TT></A>,
specifying the object to be exported
and the target interface with which to export it.
The object must in fact implement the target interface.
A unihandle attached to that object is returned.
<P>
To export an object with multiple target interfaces
so it can be invoked via a unihandle, call
<A HREF="M2MI.html#getUnihandle(java.lang.Object, java.lang.Class[])"><TT>M2MI.getUnihandle(Object,Class[])</TT></A>,
specifying the object to be exported
and an array of target interfaces.
The object must in fact implement all the target interfaces.
A unihandle attached to that object is returned.
<P>
The returned unihandle object implements interfaces
<A HREF="Handle.html">Handle</A> and
<A HREF="Unihandle.html">Unihandle</A>.
The returned unihandle object also implements
the specified target interface(s).
To invoke a certain target method
on the exported object attached to a unihandle,
cast the unihandle object to the target interface,
then call the target method on the unihandle object.
<P>
When an object is exported
and attached to a unihandle
for certain target interface(s),
the object can also be invoked
via an omnihandle for any of the target interface(s).
<P>
A unihandle is always attached to some exported object.
You can attach a unihandle to a different object by calling
<A HREF="Unihandle.html#attach(java.lang.Object)"><TT>attach()</TT></A>
on the unihandle object.
However, you can only do this
in the same process that originally created the unihandle.
Afterwards, target method invocations
performed on the unihandle object
will be executed by the new target object
instead of the old target object.
The old target object remains exported
and can still be invoked via any other handle
that refers to the object.
<P>
You can also detach a unihandle from its target object by calling
<A HREF="Unihandle.html#detach()"><TT>detach()</TT></A>
on the unihandle object.
Again, you can only do this
in the same process that originally created the unihandle.
Afterwards, target method invocations
performed on the unihandle object
will no longer be executed by any object.
The old target object remains exported
and can still be invoked via any other handle
that refers to the object.
Once a unihandle is detached,
the unihandle becomes unusable
and you cannot later attach another object to it.
If you need to do that, use a multihandle instead.
<P>
A unihandle implements the
<A HREF="Unihandle.html#equals(java.lang.Object)"><TT>equals()</TT></A> and
<A HREF="Unihandle.html#hashCode()"><TT>hashCode()</TT></A> methods.
Thus, unihandles can be used with the Java Collections Framework
as set elements, map keys, and so on.

<P>
<H3>2.4. Working With Multihandles</H3>

<P>
To establish a set of specific target objects
that are all invoked together,
first create a multihandle,
then attach the target objects to the multihandle.
<P>
To obtain a multihandle for a certain target interface, call
<A HREF="M2MI.html#getMultihandle(java.lang.Class)"><TT>M2MI.getMultihandle(Class)</TT></A>,
specifying the target interface.
A multihandle is returned.
<P>
To obtain a multihandle for multiple target interfaces, call
<A HREF="M2MI.html#getMultihandle(java.lang.Class[])"><TT>M2MI.getMultihandle(Class[])</TT></A>,
specifying an array of target interfaces.
A multihandle is returned.
<P>
To export an object so it can be invoked via a multihandle, call
<A HREF="Multihandle.html#attach(java.lang.Object)"><TT>attach(Object)</TT></A>
on the multihandle,
specifying the object to be attached.
The object must in fact implement
all of the multihandle's target interface(s).
<P>
The returned multihandle object implements interfaces
<A HREF="Handle.html">Handle</A> and
<A HREF="Multihandle.html">Multihandle</A>.
The returned multihandle object also implements
the specified target interface(s).
To invoke a certain target method
on every exported object attached to a multihandle,
cast the multihandle object to the target interface,
then call the target method on the multihandle object.
<P>
A target object can be detached from a multihandle by calling
<A HREF="Multihandle.html#detach(java.lang.Object)"><TT>detach(Object)</TT></A>
on the multihandle,
specifying the object to be detached.
Afterwards, target method invocations
performed on the multihandle object
will no longer be executed by the target object.
The target object remains exported
and can still be invoked via any other handle
that refers to the object.
<P>
A multihandle implements the
<A HREF="Multihandle.html#equals(java.lang.Object)"><TT>equals()</TT></A> and
<A HREF="Multihandle.html#hashCode()"><TT>hashCode()</TT></A> methods.
Thus, multihandles can be used with the Java Collections Framework
as set elements, map keys, and so on.

<P>
<H3>2.5. Exceptions During M2MI Invocations</H3>

<P>
While an M2MI-callable method
cannot throw any checked exceptions (type Exception),
it can throw unchecked exceptions (type RuntimeException or Error).
Unchecked exceptions can be thrown in two contexts:
when a calling object is invoking a target method on a handle,
and when the M2MI layer is invoking a target method
on an actual target object.
<P>
When a calling object invokes a target method on a handle,
the ultimate target objects are not invoked just yet,
so no exceptions of any kind
are thrown from the target objects to the calling object.
However, the M2MI layer may throw an unchecked exception
to the calling object
if it is unable to set up the invocation.
The unchecked exception may be an
<A HREF="InvocationException.html">InvocationException</A>
indicating a failure to serialize
one of the method's arguments;
make sure all the arguments are serializable.
The InvocationException may also indicate
a failure to send an outgoing message
to trigger invocations on objects
in other processes or devices.
The unchecked exception may also be
any other RuntimeException or Error,
typically indicating a software defect
in the M2MI layer.
<P>
When the M2MI layer invokes a target method
on an actual target object,
the target method will not throw any checked exceptions
(otherwise it could not have been invoked via M2MI).
However, the target method
or the M2MI layer itself
may throw an unchecked exception.
Such exceptions cause a stack trace
to be printed on the standard error stream
of the process containing the target object.
However, the M2MI layer continues to operate.
The unchecked exception may be an
<A HREF="InvocationException.html">InvocationException</A>
indicating a failure to deserialize
one of the method's arguments;
make sure all the arguments are serializable.
The InvocationException may also indicate
that the destination process cannot find the class
for one of the method's arguments;
make sure the destination process possesses
all the requisite classes.
(M2MI does not automatically download classes
like Java RMI does.)
The unchecked exception may also be
any other RuntimeException or Error,
typically indicating a software defect
in the M2MI layer.

<A NAME="examples"><H2>3. M2MI Examples</H2></A>

<P>
M2MI was designed as a paradigm and infrastructure
for distributed ad hoc collaborative applications.
Package <A HREF="test/package-summary.html">edu.rit.m2mi.test</A>
has two examples:
a <A HREF="test/package-summary.html#chatdemo">Chat Demo</A>
and a <A HREF="test/package-summary.html#pingpong">Ping-Pong Demo</A>.
It also has an
<A HREF="test/package-summary.html#m2miwatch">M2MIWatch</A> program
to help debug M2MI-based applications.
The M2MI technical report
[<A HREF="#KB02a">KB02a</A>]
has more ideas for M2MI-based distributed applications.
<P>
M2MI is also useful as a paradigm and infrastructure
for parallel programming.
The following packages contain examples
of M2MI-based parallel programs:
<UL>
<LI>
Package <A HREF="life3/package-summary.html">edu.rit.m2mi.life3</A> &#151;
John Horton Conway's Game of Life.

<P>
We are still in the initial stages
of investigating M2MI
as a paradigm for ad hoc collaborative applications
and as a paradigm for parallel programming.
Future releases of the M2MI Library
will include additional examples

<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="doc-files/m2miarch.png">
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>Figure 7: M2MI architecture</B></FONT>
</CENTER>

<P>
As Figure 7 shows,
when a calling object invokes a method on a handle,
M2MI invocations may need to go to three places:
to exported objects in the same process as the calling object,
to exported objects in other processes on the same device,
and to exported objects in other devices.

<P>
<H3>4.1. M2MI Invocations Within the Same Process</H3>

<P>
An M2MI invocation begins with a handle.
The handle contains an <EM>exported object identifier</EM> (EOID) &#151;
either a unique value corresponding to a unihandle or multihandle,
or a wildcard value corresponding to an omnihandle.
The M2MI layer set the handle's EOID
when the handle was created.
<P>
The calling object kicks things off
by invoking a method on the handle.
The handle serializes the method arguments if any
and forwards the invocation to the M2MI layer
in the same process,
providing this information:
the EOID,
the target interface name,
the target method name,
the target method descriptor,
and the serialized method arguments.
The M2MI layer attempts to map the EOID (for a unihandle or multihandle)
or the target interface name (for an omnihandle)
to the associated exported objects.
If any are found,
the M2MI layer sets up a <EM>method invoker</EM>
for each target object
and stores the serialized method arguments
in the method invoker.
The method invokers are placed in a queue
and run by a separate thread or threads.
When run, each method invoker deserializes the method arguments
and invokes the target method in the target interface
on its associated target object.

<P>
<H3>4.2. M2MI Invocations to Other Processes Within the Same Device</H3>

<P>
The M2MI layer uses the Many-to-Many Protocol (M2MP)
to broadcast the invocation to other processes and devices.
(See package <A HREF="../m2mp/package-summary.html">edu.rit.m2mp</A>.)
The M2MI layer generates an M2MP message
containing the information provided by the handle
and sends the message via the M2MP layer.
<P>
The M2MP layer is responsible
for broadcasting each M2MI invocation message
to all processes running M2MI
in the same device and other devices.
Ideally, the operating system kernel would support M2MP,
just as it supports TCP/IP.
M2MP messages would be sent to other processes in the same device
through shared memory.
M2MP messages would be sent to other devices
by routing them to an external broadcast network.
At present, however,
M2MP is implemented at the user level,
not in the kernel.
<P>
The M2MP layer uses a <EM>channel</EM>
to send and receive M2MP messages.
To go between processes in the same device,
in lieu of shared memory
the M2MP layer uses an <EM>M2MP router channel.</EM>
M2MP messages are conveyed as UDP datagrams
sent to a certain port
on the loopback interface (127.0.0.1:5678).
A separate daemon process, the <EM>M2MP router,</EM>
receives each message
and sends a copy back
to all the M2MP router channels
in all the processes with an M2MP layer
(except the one it came from).
<P>
The M2MP layer matches each incoming message
against a group of <EM>message filters.</EM>
Only those incoming messages that match a message filter
will be passed on to higher layers;
other incoming messages are discarded.
When the M2MI layer exports an object
to be invoked by an omnihandle,
the M2MI layer registers message filters
that will match an M2MI message
containing any of the omnihandle's target interfaces.
When the M2MI layer exports an object
to be invoked by a unihandle or multihandle,
the M2MI layer registers a message filter
that will match an M2MI message
containing the unihandle's or multihandle's EOID.
Thus, the M2MI layer will receive from the M2MP layer
only those M2MI messages
that will result in invocations on objects
actually exported in the M2MI layer.
<P>
When it receives an incoming M2MI invocation message,
the M2MI layer obtains from the message
the information that was supplied by the originally invoked handle.
The M2MI layer then maps the EOID or target interface name
to the associated exported objects
and sets up and runs method invokers for those objects,
just as though the invocation had originated locally.

<P>
<H3>4.3. M2MI Invocations to Other Devices</H3>

<P>
To send M2MI invocations between devices,
the M2MP router process
forwards a copy of each outgoing M2MP message
to the external broadcast network
as well as to the local processes.
The M2MP router process
also listens to the external broadcast network,
receives incoming messages from other devices,
and forwards copies to the M2MP router channels
to be received by local processes.
Messages on the external broadcast network
are conveyed as UDP datagrams
sent to a unicast IP address
(if there is just one other device)
or to a multicast IP address
(if there is more than one other device).
<P>
Once an M2MI invocation message from another device
is injected into the M2MP router channels,
the message is processed in exactly the same way
as messages originating within the same device.
<P>
The M2MP Router could interface to the external broadcast network
in different ways.
It could use UDP datagrams over an 802.11 wireless Ethernet.
It could send M2MP messages
directly in Ethernet frames
rather than going through the TCP/IP stack.
It could use other wireless networking technology,
such as Bluetooth.
Future work on M2MI
will explore these possibilities.

<P>
<H3>4.4. Proxy Synthesis</H3>

<P>
Other remote method invocation systems,
such as CORBA and Java RMI,
are implemented using <EM>proxies</EM>.
On the calling side,
a <EM>sending proxy</EM> or <EM>stub</EM>
converts a method call to an outgoing message.
On the called side,
a <EM>receiving proxy</EM> or <EM>skeleton</EM>
converts an incoming message
back into a method call on the target object.
The classes for the stub and skeleton objects
typically must be generated, compiled,
and installed before starting the system,
although Java RMI lets proxy classes be downloaded
at run time from a codebase server.
<P>
M2MI is also implemented using proxies:
the handle is the sending proxy,
and the method invoker is the receiving proxy.
However, the classes for M2MI handles and method invokers
do not have to be generated, compiled, and installed
ahead of time.
Instead, the M2MI layer automatically <EM>synthesizes</EM>
the binary class file
for each handle class and each method invoker class,
as needed, at run time,
and automatically loads each synthesized class
into the Java Virtual Machine
using a special internal class loader.
This eliminates all the extra work
associated with RMI proxies
and makes M2MI-based applications
easier to develop and deploy.
<P>
To synthesize its handle and method invoker classes,
the M2MI layer makes use of the RIT Classfile Library,
a general purpose library for class file synthesis.
(See package <A HREF="../classfile/package-summary.html">edu.rit.classfile</A>.)

<P>
<H3>4.5. Queuing Behavior</H3>

<P>
M2MI is a queuing system.
Application threads perform invocations on handles;
separate threads inside the M2MI layer
actually invoke the target objects.
Invocations are placed in a queue to await processing.
<P>
As in any queuing system,
it is possible to put items into the queue
faster than they are taken out.
That is,
it is possible to write an M2MI-based application
where one or more threads
generate M2MI invocations so quickly
that the threads inside the M2MI layer
do not get enough CPU time
to read and process all the invocations.
If this happens, the invocation messages
will queue up in the M2MP layer.
However, the M2MP layer has a fixed maximum amount of buffer space
for holding queued messages.
If the queue grows too large,
the buffer space will become exhausted.
Then, when an invocation is performed,
the M2MP layer will throw an
<A HREF="../m2mp/packet/OutOfPacketsException.html">OutOfPacketsException</A>,
and the M2MI layer will throw an
<A HREF="InvocationException.html">InvocationException</A>
wrapping the OutOfPacketsException.
<P>
This situation can be alleviated temporarily
by configuring the M2MP layer
with more buffer space.
However, the real solution
is to redesign the application
so invocations are not performed
faster than they can be processed.

Changed the channel implementation
used to broadcast M2MP messages
to all processes on the local host
so it will work properly on Sun Solaris systems
as well as Linux systems;
the implementation is now contained in classes
edu.rit.m2mp.ip.M2MPRouter (revised) and
edu.rit.m2mp.ip.M2MPRouterChannel (new).
Changed the chat demo application
(class edu.rit.m2mi.test.ChatDemo)
to put the user interface in a separate class
from the exported chat object.
