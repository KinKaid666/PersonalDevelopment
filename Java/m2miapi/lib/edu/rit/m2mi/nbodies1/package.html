Package edu.rit.m2mi.nbodies1
is a program for the N Bodies Problem
using M2MI.
Each of the bodies is electrically charged,
so each body repels every other body
with a force inversely proportional
to the square of the distance between them.
Each of the bodies also experiences
a central restoring force
as though it were attached by a spring to the origin,
with a force directly proportional
to the distance from the origin.
The program calculates and displays
each body's position as a function of time.
<P>
Class <A HREF="NBodies1.html">NBodies1</A> is the main program.
To run the program, execute this command,
substituting the desired values for the parameters:
<P>
<TT>java edu.rit.m2mi.nbodies1.NBodies1 20 10 1 0.1 100 9982734</TT>
<P>
The parameters are:
<UL>
<LI>
The number of bodies, <I>n</I>
<LI>
The display radius, <I>r</I>;
the X axis and the Y axis
both range from -<I>r</I> to +<I>r</I>
<LI>
The charge of each body
<LI>
The amount of simulated time for each step
<LI>
The amount of real time for each step (milliseconds)
<LI>
A random seed
</UL>
<P>
The bodies are given random initial positions and velocities.
The program then displays a GUI
showing the bodies' motion as time passes:
