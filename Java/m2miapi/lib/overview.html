<DL COMPACT>

<P><DT>02-Jul-2002
<DD>
Changed the channel implementation
used to broadcast M2MP messages
to all processes on the local host
so it will work properly on Sun Solaris systems
as well as Linux systems;
the implementation is now contained in classes
edu.rit.m2mp.ip.M2MPRouter (revised) and
edu.rit.m2mp.ip.M2MPRouterChannel (new).
Changed the chat demo application
(class edu.rit.m2mi.test.ChatDemo)
to put the user interface in a separate class
from the exported chat object.
