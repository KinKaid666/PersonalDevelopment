PLEASE NOTE that I have modified both the projection and transformation
tutorials in such a way that the original object displayed, i.e., the 
porsche for transformation and Al Capone for projection, are displayed
at approximately the same size under all projections.  This was done
so that it will be easier for you to do direct comparisons of effects when
you run side-by-side versions of the same tutorial using different projection
types (as in homework2)!

==============================================================================
This directory contains Nate Robins (http://www.xmission.com/~nate/opengl.html)
OpenGL tutorials and source.  These have been used in interactive SIGGRAPH 
courses on OpenGL for the past few years.  These are written in C.

To use, download the executables and the data directory into your account.

These are very nice tutorials that allow the user to interactive look at the
affects of varying parameters to openGL calls.  When executed, a snippet of 
code is presented in one of the windows.  Each of the parameters shown in
green can be modified by putting the cursor over the parameter and holding
down the left mouse button and moving up and down.  The effect appears 
immediately in the graphics windows.

The right mouse button lets you check out other things, such as different
models and different modeling techniques.

If you want to see the source, that is available as well as a Makefile.
To compile, simply type 

	make PROG=xxxx

where "xxxx" is the name of the .c file you want to use, i.e., make "PROG=foo"
will use "foo.c" to create "foo".

If there is no executable file for a particular c file, that means that that
is a helper file and is used one or more of the tutorials.  For example, 
"glm.c" is a program that reads model information.  The "data" directory 
supplies model data, required by some of the tutorials.
