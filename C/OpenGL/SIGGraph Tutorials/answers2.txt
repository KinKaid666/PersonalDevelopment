     of these two commands is swapped? (See right mouse button menu or type
     "s".)

     The image is rotated 30 degrees counter clockwise, and when the 
     commands are switched there is a difference, but it is very minimal and 
     hard to describe.  The image is moved more towards the top left 
     corner of the screen when the glRoatatef function is called first.
